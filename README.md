# Data Cleaning for Food Delivery Records

## Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive data cleaning process applied to food delivery records. The goal is to transform raw, potentially inconsistent data into a clean, standardized, and reliable dataset ready for analysis and reporting. The cleaning process leverages the power of the Pandas library in Python to address common data quality issues.

## Key Features

*   **Null Value Identification:** Uses Pandas to detect and quantify missing values (nulls) in the dataset.
*   **Column Selection:** Employs Pandas to select and retain only the columns relevant for analysis, ensuring a focused dataset.
*   **Unnecessary Column Removal:** Leverages Pandas to drop redundant or irrelevant columns, reducing data complexity and improving processing efficiency.
*   **Column Renaming:** Standardizes column headers using Pandas, ensuring consistency and clarity for easier data understanding and manipulation.
*   **Duplicate Record Removal:** Utilizes Pandas to identify and eliminate duplicate entries, ensuring data uniqueness and integrity.
*   **Missing Value Handling:** Implements Pandas techniques to handle missing values (NaNs) through either removal or appropriate imputation methods (e.g., filling with mean, median, or a specific value), minimizing bias.
*   **Age Column Correction:** Converts 'Age' values from years to months (where applicable) by multiplying values by 12, standardizing the time unit for consistent analysis.
*   **Data Standardization:** Standardizes department names using Pandas to ensure uniformity and eliminate inconsistencies arising from different naming conventions.
*   **Numeric Field Validation:** Validates numeric fields (e.g., delivery time, order amount) to identify and correct or remove invalid entries, ensuring accurate calculations and analyses.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd Data-Cleaning-Food-Deliveries
    ```
2.  **Load the Data:**
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv('Cleaned_onlinefoods_data.csv')  # Or your original data file
    ```
3.  **Run the Data Cleaning Script (if applicable)**:  If you have a separate script to run the data cleaning process:
    ```
    python data_cleaning_script.py
    ```
4.  **Cleaned Data Location:** The cleaned data will be saved in the `data/Online Orders/` directory (or a location specified in your script).

## Tools Used

*   **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
*   **Pandas**: Version 1.4 or higher. A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.

## Example Code Snippets

*Identifying Null Values:*

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('Cleaned_onlinefoods_data.csv')
null_counts = data.isnull().sum()
print(null_counts)

text

*Dropping Unnecessary Columns:*

columns_to_drop = ['column_name_1', 'column_name_2'] # Replace with actual column names
data = data.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)

text

*Renaming Columns:*

data = data.rename(columns={'old_name': 'new_name', 'another_old_name': 'another_new_name'})

## Future Enhancements

*   Implement more sophisticated data validation rules based on domain expertise.
*   Create reusable functions for common data cleaning tasks.
*   Automate the data cleaning process using a scheduled task or workflow.
*   Add unit tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data cleaning steps.
